 This article will give you an overview of PitchPrint, outlining its features, user cases, workflows and general best practices. We advise every new customer to take some time and briefly read through this to get a hang of the product.Why, What, How
 If you sell customizable products or want your customers to personalize their orders or to make digital designs on your website or online store, PitchPrint is your solution. You may have an existing website or not, the thing is standard websites don't provide that capability to design products online and that's where PitchPrint comes in.
 It's basically a "
light-photoshop" you install on your store that will allow your customers to create personalized designs like Business Cards with their unique details, Mugs, TShirts, Phone Casings and what not, all in the convenience of their web browser.
 It seamlessly plugs into your web-store and kicks in where customers need to personalize any of your products.

 Clicking this should load the PitchPrint editor displaying your design template, ready for customization. Go ahead and customize the design to your taste.Getting your print files
 Once you have submitted your customized design, a project is generated, which PDF you can download from your admin page. Check the order page of your store admin. Against the new order, you will find option to download the PDF file for that product order. If you are on Shopify or 3DCart, you will need to check our projects page to get the PDF file as these platforms do not allow app developers to place codes into the order page.More features
