 PitchPrint 3D View allows you to view a model from a front and back perspective. In order to do this a two page design template design needs to be created and assigned to a 3D model. Page 1 will be the front of the business card and page 2 will be the back of the business card.

Creating a two page design in PitchPrint

Navigate to Designs in the PitchPrint admin.
Select the new design button and create a design that consists of two pages.
 Page 1 will be the front of the business card.
 
 Page 2 will be the back of the business card. Select the Preview button on the top right and submit the design.

 Creating a texture image for a business card

 
     Create a canvas of 1024x1024 in any design software such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop etc.


     The canvas needs to be divided into two sections, a top and bottom section.


     Create two rectangular blocks of equal size.


     The front of the business card design will be placed on the top half of the canvas and the back of the business card will be placed on the bottom half of the canvas.


     Open the artwork you want to apply to the 3D model in a design program and place the front of the business card design on the top half of the canvas and the back of the business card design at the bottom of the canvas.


     Save the file as a PNG.


     This texture file will replace the default image when selecting the change texture file button.
UV Mapping the 3D model
 

 The UV Mapping of the model should be identical to the texture file created in the above step.

 The below image will be displayed once selecting the button. This helps to set the artwork boundary areas of the design. 
 
 In the Search designs tab. Copy the name of the 2 page design you assigned to the model and press enter.
 

 Once you press enter the design name will show by the selection box. Select the design of your choice and select page 1 and set the boundary boxes to the top half of the texture file.
 Select Page 2 and set the boundary boxes to the bottom half of the texture file.
 
 Select the hide configuration button and you will be able to see how the texture file displays on the front and back of the model. Auto rotate allows you to see the model from various perspectives. Click save on completion.
