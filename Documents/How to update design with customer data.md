When used in some cart frameworks: OpenCart, WordPress and PrestaShop, it plays nice to have the customer's data reflected in the design once they are signed in.
So something like a customer's name can be reflected on a business card design when it loads without them having to do anything yet. The app will fetch the data from the underlying cart framework and update the design to reflect these values. The following are values being watched:

Email
Telephone
Firstname
Lastname
Name
Address
This is done automatically but the admin needs to link these values to text elements placed on the design canvas. To do this:

Load your design in edit mode or create a new design
Select a text item you will like to link on the canvas
Open the Admin Tab and Label that item any of the above listed values: email or telephone... as shown in the image below:
Save your design and check the result on your store front by logging in as a customer and try edit the design. The email text should reflect your (customer's) actual email address.
The "Name" is a combination of both firstname + lastname to form a full name
