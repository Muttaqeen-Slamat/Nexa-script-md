 Your default PitchPrint domain comes with a few set of general fonts but you can add your own custom fonts to enhance user choices and creativity. There are two types of Fonts required for the application to function properly. The  
TTF and Woff font file types. The TTF is used in generating the final PDF file while the Woff is a web based font file system used predominantly in browsers because of its light weight and faster loading time.
 Luckily now PitchPrint requires you to upload only one font file of either format. The application will convert and create the other missing format from the uploaded file. From experience, it’s best you upload a full TTF Font file though Woff also works fine in converting to TTF.
 So to get started, navigate to your 
Fonts Page and click the “Upload Own Font” button at the top.
 A popup window will load where you can select the files that you would like to upload from the files on your system as shown below:Select the font you would like to upload andThe app will generate a thumbnail of the font file and can be accessible from the front end of your store. If it is not showing on your store, perhaps you need to include it in your design if per chance you have excluded all fonts or you have only included a select few in your design.
