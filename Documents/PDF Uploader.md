We designed our platform to empower customers to seamlessly upload PDF files, which are then converted to SVGs or flattened as PNGs for editing. This functionality enables users to edit their designs directly on the canvas, enhancing their creative experience.Current Conversion LimitationsSVG Conversion: When a PDF is converted to SVG, users can only modify color options. Unfortunately, other editing capabilities are limited.PNG Conversion: Flattening a PDF to PNG results in a complete loss of editing options, as all elements are merged into a single image.Enhanced Editing with PDF UploaderTo address these limitations, we developed the PDF uploader feature. This tool allows administrators to:Upload PDF Files: Simplifying the design process by enabling direct uploads.Edit Text: Modify any text elements within the PDF for greater customization.Group and Ungroup Items: Easily manage design elements for more flexibility.Move and Scale Images: Adjust the positioning and size of images to fit the desired layout.Change Backgrounds: Customize the background within the editor for a more tailored look.This advanced functionality significantly reduces the time and effort required to create designs from scratch. Instead, admins can upload existing files, make necessary adjustments, and save them as new designs, streamlining the workflow and enhancing productivity.We believe this enhancement will greatly benefit our users by providing more robust editing options and improving the overall design experience on PitchPrint.To make use of the PDF uploader please go to Designs >> Click on Import Designs.Then click on Upload Design PDF as shown below:Select the file you would like to upload from your local storage and the file will be added as a design in the selected category.Please note that this feature is still in BETA mode and we will continue to add functionality. Please reach out to us via support@pitchprint.com with any suggestions or questions.
