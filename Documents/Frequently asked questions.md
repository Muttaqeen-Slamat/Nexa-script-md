  What is PitchPrint?  

 PitchPrint is a product customizer solution offered as Software Service. 
 It allows you to convert your Printing Website into a DIY platform where your users can basically edit design templates using text, shape, images etc and submit for print. 
 The system generates a print-ready PDF file of exactly what your customer designs using the tool on your website. 
 So without any Photoshop skills, your users can create their Business Cards, Calendars, Photo Album, etc on your website without stress.


  What do I need to set up my store?  

 On your end, you basically need the minimum requirements for each platform you want to install. For PitchPrint, a bulk of the work is done on our servers. So you should check out software requirements for any of OpenCart, PrestaShop, WordPress or Shopify depending on which you prefer to use. For a minimum low traffic site, a shared hosting is about enough.


  Does it work on iPad?  

 YES it does. It loads and performs same as desktop mode with UI windows minimized to give the canvas a fair share of the screen. When an action is activated, like add Picture, the picture panel pops up and auto hides once the action is finalized. 
 You should check out the demos on your iPad.


  What do I get when a client makes an order?  

 When a client submits an order, you get the project details with option to load and edit the project, a PDF file of the order and screenshot of what the client has designed as a proof.
 In addition, you can opt to download a high resolution raster image of the client’s design zipped as a collection of png files


  Can I change the theme of the app?  

 Yes. The app installs with up to eleven different themes based on five colors and you can change those to suit your site look.
 In addition, you can as well change the layout of the application to your taste.


  Can I upload my own fonts and pictures?  

 Absolutely yes. You can upload your own fonts, images and SVG shapes.


  Do I get future upgrades and how?  

 Updates are automatically reflected on the application once pushed out. That’s the core advantage of SaaS.
 Updates instantly reflect on your site and we work to ensure none of your existing system is broken for any reason.


  Does the product come with templates and clipart images?  

 The product comes with few templates and cliparts. However, you are advised to purchase your own library to suit your client base and product needs.
 Also, we are working on a marketplace where designers get to share template ideas. You can start from there and pick your choice as well as create and share with others.


  I have an existing shop. Can I still install PitchPrint on it?  

 Absolutely. You can install it over your existing OpenCart, WordPress, PrestaShop, Shopify or personal custom site without doing a fresh cart installation


  Where will our files be hosted?  

 PitchPrint is a Software as Service platform with dedicated servers for processing and storage.
 Your Picture and PDF files are stored on Amazon S3 storage servers. Design files are stored on our dedicated SSD based servers for swift random access and you can request for your files at anytime. 
 You can also use out Runtime API service to connect to the server and download any of your files with the appropriate authentication.


  I have a custom website. Can I still use this service?  

 YES! Very much you can easily integrate the app into your existing website using our API service

How do I access the print-ready PDF Files?

You have two options here you can use either Zapier or Webhooks.

You will have to create a 'trigger' that when a order is processed the Print-ready PDF is saved into another app (e.g. Dropbox).
Which allows for easier access to PDF files.


  Can I become your re-seller?  

 You can contact our sales team to table your intent via email.
