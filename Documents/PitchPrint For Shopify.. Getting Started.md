 PitchPrint for Shopify allows your site visitors to customize products on your site to their taste and needs right from your website.
 So business cards, TShirts, Mugs, Letter Heads etc can be customized by your customers to their look and feel before adding to cart.
 To get started, you need to first first create your Shopify Store. If you have not, you can do that freely on 
www.shopify.com and afterwards, login to your Shopify store admin and then go to Apps. In apps, search for “PitchPrint”. Then install the PitchPrint app.
 After the installation is complete it will take you to the login page 
https://admin.pitchprint.com/login use the credentials sent your email address to log in(Please note this will be the same email address linked to your Shopify Store, please check your inbox and all other folders). After logging in it will take you to the Dashboard page which looks like this:
In the Dashboard page, click the designs button in the left panel.
 In the Designs page, you get to create custom designs that you can assign to your products. This makes it easy for your customers to get started as against starting a new design afresh. Alternatively, you can import designs into a category from our designs stores by clicking the Import Designs on the top right corner of the category.

 Once you have created or imported your designs, you need to assign them to your products. Go to 
products >> mouse over the product where you would like to assign a design. Then click Assign a Design, choose a design from the list.To assign your design to a product, simply mouse over the product and you will see four options: Assign a Design, Full Window, Upload and Required.
 Assign design allows you to assign a design to the product. You can also assign categories to the products so that your customers can pick from a whole design category as against a single design. Once you have assigned a design to the product or enabled uploads, check your product page, you should find the Customize Now or Upload button there.
 Full Window allows you to choose a display mode, there are three display modes available on Pitchprint you can read more about display modes 
here.
 Upload allows your customers to upload their existing designs rather than modify yours. Click on the button if the button is green the feature is enabled if it is grey it will be disabled.
Required is a toggle switch when enabled allows you to force customisation, this means that the customer won't be able to add the product to the cart unless they successfully submit a Pitchprint design.
 After assigning a design to your product, go ahead and test this out in the front store. You should find a “
Customize this design” button as shown:Once an order is placed with a custom design, you can always download the designs and uploaded files by going to the top right corner and clicking the context menu -> Download PitchPrint Files:
